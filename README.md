## Game Rules
    - The board is divided into 9 individual boards
    - On first move every board is playable
    - Each play on a individual board, takes the next player to the respective board where the player played
    - When redirecting to an already won board, the next player can choose all available boards
    - The player that can make a winning Tic Tac Toe combination of wins of individual boards, wins the game!

## Requirements
    - Java
    - JavaFX

## TODO

- [ ] Ties on Big Board
- [ ] Quit and Save
- [ ] Visual improvements
